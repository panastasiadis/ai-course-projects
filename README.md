# AI and IoT Applications Projects

This repository contains three projects developed as part of the Artificial Intelligence and IoT Applications course. Each project focuses on different aspects of AI and IoT technologies.

## Project Structure

### Project 1: Time Series Classification
Located in the `project1/` directory, this project focuses on time series data classification with 6 different classes. The project includes:
- Time series data analysis and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and data visualization
- Machine learning model development using TensorFlow
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- The dataset contains 7,352 training samples and 2,947 test samples with 128 time steps and 9 features each

### Project 2: Weather Image Classification
Located in the `project2/` directory, this project implements a computer vision system for weather condition classification. The project includes:
- Image classification of weather conditions (sunrise, shine, cloudy, rain)
- Dataset organization and preprocessing
- Deep learning model development using TensorFlow/Keras
- Model evaluation with confusion matrices
- Custom photo testing capabilities
- The dataset contains 1,125 images split into training (60%), validation (20%), and test (20%) sets

### Project 3: Natural Language Processing
Located in the `project3/` directory, this project explores various NLP tasks using state-of-the-art transformer models. The project includes:
- Emotion classification using RoBERTa
- Zero-shot classification using BART
- Token classification (POS tagging) using BERT
- Model evaluation and performance analysis
- Integration with Hugging Face's transformers library
- Practical applications in sentiment analysis and text classification

## Getting Started

Each project directory contains its own set of resources and documentation. To get started with any project:

1. Navigate to the specific project directory
2. Review the project PDF for detailed requirements and objectives
3. Check the notebook directory for implementation details
4. Follow the instructions in the respective project's documentation

## Requirements
